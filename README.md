This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using html, CSS, Javascript, d3, and Leaflet, working in VScode. The goal of the project was to use Leaflet to visualise USGS earthquake data on a map. Using starter HTML and CSS code provided as a skeleton for the project, a Javascript file was created to build the map. First, the earthquake data was obtained using d3. Then, Javascript functions were constructed to build the map, create a legend, and apply markers that change in size and color based on earthquake depth and magnitude. The specific earthquake data used is for events in the past hour so the data updates frequently and the markers change often. This means that there are fewer markers on the map than there would be if a longer period of time (ie 30 days of data) was used but the frequency with which the data is updated makes the map interesting and dynamic.
